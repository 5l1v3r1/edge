# EDGE Bioinformatics

This is version 1.1 of EDGE Bioinformatics, a product of collaboration between Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Naval Medical Research Center sponsored by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

EDGE is a highly adaptable bioinformatics platform that allows laboratories to quickly analyze and interpret genomic sequence data. The bioinformatics platform allows users to address a wide range of use cases including assay validation and the characterization of novel biological threats, clinical samples, and complex environmental samples.

The EDGE package is available for demonstration and limited use at https://bioedge.lanl.gov/edge_ui/. Follow the "GUI" instructions from our documentation, found at https://edge.readthedocs.org/en/latest/introduction.html.
