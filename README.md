EDGE Bioinformatics
===================

EDGE is a highly adaptable bioinformatics platform that allows laboratories to quickly analyze and interpret genomic sequence data. The platform allows users to address a wide range of use cases including assay validation and the characterization of novel biological threats, clinical samples, and complex environmental samples.

To run EDGE, go to https://bioedge.lanl.gov/edge_ui/ and follow the "GUI" instructions from our documentation, found at https://edge.readthedocs.org/en/latest/introduction.html. It is also linked at the bottom of the EDGE homepage.
