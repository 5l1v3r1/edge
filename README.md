# EDGE Bioinformatics

This is version 1.1 of EDGE Bioinformatics, a product of collaboration between Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Naval Medical Research Center sponsored by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

The EDGE package is available for demonstration and limited use at https://bioedge.lanl.gov/edge_ui/. Follow the "GUI" instructions from our documentation, found at https://edge.readthedocs.org/en/latest/introduction.html.

## Abstract

Edge Bioinformatics is a developmental bioinformatics and data management platform which seeks to supply laboratories with bioinformatics pipelines for analyzing data associated with common samples case goals. Edge Bioinformatics enables sequencing as a solution and forward-deployed situations where human-resources, space, bandwidth, and time are limited. The Edge bioinformatics pipeline was designed based on following USE CASES and specific to illumina sequencing reads. 1. Assay performance adjudication (PCR): Analysis of an existing PCR assay in a genomic context, and automated design of a new assay to resolve conflicting results 2. Clinical presentation with extreme symptoms: Characterization of a known pathogen or co-infection with a. Novel emerging disease outbreak or b. Environmental surveillance
