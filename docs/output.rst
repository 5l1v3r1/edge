EDGE generates an interactive webpage.

Example:


This includes summary statistics and taxonomic information ...
The easiest way to interact with the results is through the web interface. 

There are seven major sub-directories in the output Directory and one final report pdf file. 

•	AssayCheck
•	AssemblyBasedAnalysis
•	QcReads
•	ReadsBasedAnalysis
•	Reference
•	JBrowse
•	SNP_Phylogeny
•	HTML_Report

When pipeline run finished in the edge_ui, user can click on the project id from the menu and it will generate the interactive html report on the fly. User can browse the data structure by clicking the project link and visualize the result by JBrowse links, download the pdf files, etc.  If pipeline run finished through the command line, user can open the report html file in the HTML_report directory off-line.
